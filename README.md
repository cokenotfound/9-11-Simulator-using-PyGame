# 9/11 Simulator

## Abstract
**9/11 Simulator** is a 2D arcade-style game built with Python and Pygame. In this game, players control a plane navigating through obstacles, simulating flight physics such as gravity and upward thrust. The goal is to avoid collisions with buildings and the ground while achieving the highest possible score by passing through obstacles. The game features dynamic building generation, continuous scrolling background, and a simple scoring system.
